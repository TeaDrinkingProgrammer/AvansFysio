# AvansFysio
A school project from the first semester of 2021/2022. The goal was to make a serverside web application using .net core for a fictional fysiotherapist office.
Aside from the programatical aspect, the project also needed to comply with UX Design standards set out by the UX Design class.
This repository is a copy of the original 2 git repos on Azure, where I also built a CI/CD pipeline, though the original link doesn't function anymore due to the free credit being depleted..  

The project exists of two parts:  
1. A web application built using .net core, Bootstrap 5, Entity Framework Core and Identity Framework Core. The web application is built according to the Onion/Clean architecture.  
2. A Web API also built using .net core and according to Onion/Clean architecture. The API can be reached using GraphQl and RESTFul queries according to RMM 2.
